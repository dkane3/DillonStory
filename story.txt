There was a man named Dillon. Dillon had a dog. He took is dog for a walk. It was a good day.

Dillon's dog took a dump. Dillon had to clean his dog's shit.  Dillon's dog was happy.

It was a beautiful day outside. Birds were singing. Flowers were blooming. Dillon walked with his dog, whistling Megalovania.

Dillon tripped on a stick, but he's okay which is cool.  This comp sci 400 midterm is going to be tough.
